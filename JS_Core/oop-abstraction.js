$ Abstraction
  > An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users.
  > In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.

  Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user.
  The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. 
  Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.

~ Hiding internal details and showing functionality only: like ATM
