// * Why do we need closure?
// Ans-Because in JS we have lexical scope this means that something in above scope can automatically available in the lower scope:
let i = 1;
const f = () => {
    console.log(i);
};
f();
// Here to solve this problem I can use closure,closure help to make the variable i private that is from outside i cannot use this i but through a function i can use its value.
let f; // function declaration
// a scope
if (true) {
    let i = 1; // data is protected from the outside
    //function definition:
    f = () => {
        console.log(i);
    };
}
f();

// This is a kind of closure--^

/* 
Closure in deep--> Interview question:
? What is closure:
    > In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. 
    > In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.


    
> To use a closure, define a function inside another function and expose it. To expose a function, return it or pass it to another function.
