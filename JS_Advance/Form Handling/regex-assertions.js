--2. Assertions:
     Assertions include boundaries, which indicate the beginnings and endings of lines and words, and other patterns indicating in some way that a match is possible (including look-ahead, look-behind, and conditional expressions).

# Boundary-type assertions
  >       ^	     Matches the beginning of input. If the multiline flag is set to true, also matches immediately after a line break character. 
                    For example, /^A/ does not match the "A" in "an A", but does match the first "A" in "An A".
                    This character has a different meaning when it appears at the start of a group.

  >       $	     Matches the end of input. If the multiline flag is set to true, also matches immediately before a line break character. 
                    For example, /t$/ does not match the "t" in "eater", but does match it in "eat".

  >       \b	     Matches a word boundary. This is the position where a word character is not followed or preceded by another word-character, such as between a letter and a space.
                    Note that a matched word boundary is not included in the match. In other words, the length of a matched word boundary is zero.
                    or in simple words:
                    > The \b metacharacter is used to find a match at the beginning or end of a word.
                      Search for the pattern at the beginning of a word like this: \bLO
                      Search for the pattern at the end of a word like this: LO\b
                      If no match is found, it returns null.
                    Examples:
                     > /\bm/ matches the "m" in "moon".
                     > /oo\b/ does not match the "oo" in "moon", because "oo" is followed by "n" which is a word character.
                     > /oon\b/ matches the "oon" in "moon", because "oon" is the end of the string, thus not followed by a word character.
                     > /\w\b\w/ will never match anything, because a word character can never be followed by both a non-word and a word character.
                    
                    To match a backspace character ([\b]), see Character Classes.

  >       \B	     Matches a non-word boundary. This is a position where the previous and next character are of the same type: Either both must be words, or both must be non-words, 
                    for example between two letters or between two spaces. 
                    The beginning and end of a string are considered non-words. 
                    Same as the matched word boundary, the matched non-word boundary is also not included in the match. 
                    For example, /\Bon/ matches "on" in "at noon", and /ye\B/ matches "ye" in "possibly yesterday".

                    or in simple words:
                    > The \B metacharacter is used to find a match, but where it is NOT at the beginning/end of a word.
                       Search for the pattern NOT at the beginning of a word like this: \BLO
                       Search for the pattern NOT at the end of a word like this: LO\B
                       If no match is found, it returns null.

# Other assertions:
  >   x(?=y)        Lookahead assertion: Matches "x" only if "x" is followed by "y". 
                    For example, /Jack(?=Sprat)/ matches "Jack" only if it is followed by "Sprat".
                    /Jack(?=Sprat|Frost)/ matches "Jack" only if it is followed by "Sprat" or "Frost". However, neither "Sprat" nor "Frost" is part of the match results.

  >   x(?!y)        Negative lookahead assertion: Matches "x" only if "x" is not followed by "y". For example, /\d+(?!\.)/ matches a number only if it is not followed by a decimal point. 
                    /\d+(?!\.)/.exec('3.141') matches "141" but not "3.

  >   (?<=y)x       Lookbehind assertion: Matches "x" only if "x" is preceded by "y". 
                    For example, /(?<=Jack)Sprat/ matches "Sprat" only if it is preceded by "Jack". 
                    /(?<=Jack|Tom)Sprat/ matches "Sprat" only if it is preceded by "Jack" or "Tom". 
                    However, neither "Jack" nor "Tom" is part of the match results.

  >   (?<!y)x       Negative lookbehind assertion: Matches "x" only if "x" is not preceded by "y". 
                    For example, /(?<!-)\d+/ matches a number only if it is not preceded by a minus sign. 
                    /(?<!-)\d+/.exec('3') matches "3". 
                    /(?<!-)\d+/.exec('-3')  match is not found because the number is preceded by the minus sign.

// General boundary-type overview example
// Using Regex boundaries to fix buggy string.
var buggyMultiline = `tey, ihe light-greon apple
tangs on ihe greon traa`;

// 1) Use ^ to fix the matching at the begining of the string, and right after newline.
buggyMultiline = buggyMultiline.replace(/^t/gim, 'h');
console.log(1, buggyMultiline); // fix 'tey', 'tangs' => 'hey', 'hangs'. Avoid 'traa'.

// 2) Use $ to fix matching at the end of the text.
buggyMultiline = buggyMultiline.replace(/aa$/gim, 'ee.');
console.log(2, buggyMultiline); // fix  'traa' => 'tree'.

// 3) Use \b to match characters right on border between a word and a space.
buggyMultiline = buggyMultiline.replace(/\bi/gim, 't');
console.log(3, buggyMultiline); // fix  'ihe' but does not touch 'light'.

// 4) Use \B to match characters inside borders of an entity.
fixedMultiline = buggyMultiline.replace(/\Bo/gim, 'e');

// Matching the beginning of input using a ^ control character

// Here '^' control symbol used only in one role: Matching beginning of an input.

// Selecting fruits that dose not start by 'A' by a /^[^A]/ regex.
// In this example, two meanings of '^' control symbol are represented:
// 1) Matching begining of the input
// 2) A negated or complemented character set: [^A]
// That is, it matches anything that is not enclosed in the brackets.

let fruitsStartsWithNotA = fruits.filter(fruit => /^[^A]/.test(fruit));

console.log(fruitsStartsWithNotA); // [ 'Watermelon', 'Orange', 'Strawberry' ]


//? Matching a word boundary

// Select descriptions that contains 'en' or 'ed' words endings:
let enEdSelection = fruitsWithDescription.filter(descr => /(en|ed)\b/.test(descr));

//? Lookahead assertion
//> JS Lookahead assertion x(?=y)

console.log('First peach'.match(regex)); // null
console.log('This is a First test in a year.'.match(regex)); // [ 'First' ]

//~ Basic negative lookahead assertion
//~ For example, /\d+(?!\.)/ matches a number only if it is not followed by a decimal point. /\d+(?!\.)/.exec('3.141') matches "141" but not "3.

console.log(/\d+(?!\.)/g.exec('3.141')); // [ '141', index: 2, input: '3.141' ]
