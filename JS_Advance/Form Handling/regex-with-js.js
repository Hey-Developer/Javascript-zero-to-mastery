/* 
$ Using regular expressions in JavaScript:
  Regular expressions are used with the RegExp methods test() and exec() and with the String methods match(), replace(), search(), and split().
  
  -- exec()	        Executes a search for a match in a string. It returns an array of information or null on a mismatch.
  
  -- test()	        Tests for a match in a string. It returns true or false.
  
  -- match()	    Returns an array containing all of the matches, including capturing groups, or null if no match is found.
  
  -- matchAll()	    Returns an iterator containing all of the matches, including capturing groups.
  
  -- search()	    Tests for a match in a string. It returns the index of the match, or -1 if the search fails.
  
  -- replace()	    Executes a search for a match in a string, and replaces the matched substring with a replacement substring.
  
  -- split()	    Uses a regular expression or a fixed string to break a string into an array of substrings.

  ? When you want to know whether a pattern is found in a string, use the test() or search() methods;
  ? for more information (but slower execution) use the exec() or match() methods
    > If you use exec() or match() and if the match succeeds, these methods return an array.
      and update properties of the associated regular expression object and also of the predefined regular expression object, RegExp. 
    > If the match fails, the exec() method returns null (which coerces to false).


*/
/* 
-- RegExp.prototype.exec()
  If the match succeeds, the exec() method returns an array (with extra properties index and input; see below) 
  and updates the lastIndex property of the regular expression object. 
  The returned array has the matched text as the first item, and then one item for each parenthetical capture group of the matched text.

console.log(result.input); //? The original string that was matched against.

 * Otherwise it will give same match again and again on using exec.

-- RegExp.prototype.test():
   The test() method executes a search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. Returns true or false.

   As with exec() (or in combination with it), test() called multiple times on the same global regular expression instance will advance past the previous match.

-- String.prototype.match()
   The match() method retrieves the result of matching a string against a regular expression.
   > str.match(regexp)
     ~ Parameters:A regular expression object.
       If regexp is a non-RegExp object, it is implicitly converted to a RegExp by using new RegExp(regexp).
       If you don't give any parameter and use the match() method directly, you will get an Array with an empty string: [""].

    ~ Return value: An Array whose contents depend on the presence or absence of the global (g) flag, or null if no matches are found.
      If the g flag is used, all results matching the complete regular expression will be returned, but capturing groups will not.
      if the g flag is not used, only the first complete match and its related capturing groups are returned. In this case, the returned item will have additional properties as described below.
  
   ~ As explained above, some results contain additional properties as described below.
     > groups
       An object of named capturing groups whose keys are the names and values are the capturing groups or undefined if no named capturing groups were defined. See Groups and Ranges for more information.
     > index
       The index of the search at which the result was found.
     > input
       A copy of the search string.

   ~ If the regular expression does not include the g flag, str.match() will return the same result as RegExp.exec().
     Other methods
     > If you need to know if a string matches a regular expression RegExp, use RegExp.test().
     > If you only want the first match found, you might want to use RegExp.exec() instead.
     > If you want to obtain capture groups and the global flag is set, you need to use RegExp.exec() or String.prototype.matchAll() instead.

// ~ Regexp.exec() and matchAll(): Prior to the addition of matchAll to JavaScript, it was possible to use calls to regexp.exec (and regexes with the /g flag) in a loop to obtain all the matches:

// ~ With matchAll available, you can avoid the while  loop and exec with g.

//~ matchAll will throw an exception if the g flag is missing.
const regexp = RegExp("[a-c]", "");

regexp.lastIndex = 1;
const str = "abc";
Array.from(str.matchAll(regexp), m => `${regexp.lastIndex} ${m[0]}`);

//~ Another compelling reason for matchAll is the improved access to capture groups.
// Capture groups are ignored when using match() with the global /g flag:
// Using matchAll, you can access capture groups easily:

let array = [...str.matchAll(regexp)];
