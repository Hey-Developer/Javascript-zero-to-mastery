/* 
$ The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest, but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.

JavaScript can send network requests to the server and load new information whenever it’s needed.

For example, we can use a network request to:

-Submit an order,
-Load user information,
-Receive latest updates from the server,
…etc.

--> Fetch Interfaces or a Fetch API Includes..
    >>WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope.fetch()
      -> The fetch() method used to fetch a resource.
    >>Headers
      -> Represents response/request headers, allowing you to query them and take different actions depending on the results.
    >>Request
      -> Represents a resource request.
    >>Response
      -> Represents the response to a request.

These Four are the fundamentals of FETCH API.
