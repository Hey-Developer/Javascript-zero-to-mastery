$ Shocked from the above output->

    ?ðŸ˜‰ Hold on i will explain.. so when we are enrolling students i.e inserting data to the server.. it talk 8 secs.
    ? and since this task is running in background it will not block further code,, therefore getStudents fn will call ..
    ? and in getStudents function we are fetching data from the server this take only 1 sec.. this is also asynchronous..
    ? So if we talk in simple words getStudents fn run before the enrollStudent() fn this means that before inserting the data to the web server we are fetching data from the server
    ? Hence it is showing the already stored data.. and not the new enrolled student..
    
    > So this seems to be bug..
    > Then what to do.. SOLn> we have to call the getStudent function only when the enrolledStudent function complete its execution..
    > But that too in asynchronous way so that our remaining code will not block during this server communication..
    > So ANS is callback.. YES using callbacks we can solve this problem..

    > HOWðŸ™„ðŸ™„..
      ? we provide a callback in enrollStudent() function which will execute after the success status of inserting student into database..
      ? And in callback parameter we provide the getStudent function  hence now getStudent() fn will only call when the insertion of data into database is successful..
      ? and since getStudent function is calling after enrolledStudent() function it will show the latest information from the database..
      > and all this process will execute in background because of setTimeout() which is asynchronous callback function..
      > In this way our dom code will also not block..

      $ lets get roll into the code..

$ Conclusion..
? We used callbacks when instead of immediately returning some result like most functions, function that use callbacks take some time to produce a results..
? for ex in the above example we used callback bcoz we want that the second function should not call immediately but after the execution of first function..
? The function used as callbacks are store in message queues and when the execution stack is empty then only that callbacks run..
? usually callbacks are only used when doing I/o e.g downloading things,reading files,talking to databases.
? In above case we use callbacks bcoz here we are communicating with our  server..
