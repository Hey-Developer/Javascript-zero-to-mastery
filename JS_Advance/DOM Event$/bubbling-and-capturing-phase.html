          Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a
          <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.

        // When the <button> is clicked, the video is displayed, by changing the class attribute on the <div> from hidden to showing-->
        btn.onclick = function() {

        };

        videoBox.onclick = function() {
            videoBox.setAttribute("class", "hidden");
        };

        /* 
              > Problem:
                currently, when you click the video it starts to play, but it causes the <div> to also be hidden at the same time. 
                This is because the video is inside the <div> — it is part of it — so clicking on the video actually runs both the above event handlers.

                Bubbling and capturing explained-->
                When an event is fired on an element that has parent elements (in this case, the <video> has the <div> as a parent), modern browsers run two different phases — 
                the capturing phase and the bubbling phase.

                In the capturing phase:
                > The browser checks to see if the element's outer-most ancestor (<html>) has an onclick event handler registered on it for the capturing phase, and runs it if so.
                > Then it moves on to the next element inside <html> and does the same thing, then the next one, and so on until it reaches the element that was actually clicked on.

                In the bubbling phase, the exact opposite occurs:
                > The browser checks to see if the element that was actually clicked on has an onclick event handler registered on it for the bubbling phase, and runs it if so.
                > Then it moves on to the next immediate ancestor element and does the same thing, then the next one, and so on until it reaches the <html> element.
               */
    </script>

            > Fixing the problem with stopPropagation()
              This is annoying behavior, but there is a way to fix it! 
              The standard Event object has a function available on it called stopPropagation() which, 
              when invoked on a handler's event object, makes it so that first handler is run but the event doesn't bubble any further up the chain, 
              so no more handlers will be run.

            > Event delegation:
              Bubbling also allows us to take advantage of event delegation — 
              this concept relies on the fact that if you want some code to run when you click on any one of a large number of child elements, 
              you can set the event listener on their parent 
              and have events that happen on them bubble up to their parent rather than having to set the event listener on every child individually. 
              Remember earlier that we said bubbling involves checking the element the event is fired on for an event handler first, then moving up to the element's parent, etc.?

              A good example is a series of list items — 
              if you want each one of them to pop up a message when clicked, 
              you can set the click event listener on the parent <ul>, 
              and events will bubble from the list items to the <ul>.
